# unit13-challenge-new
In this assignment we used Amazon Lex and Lambda to create a chat bot that validated user inputs and then recommended an investment portfolio.
The assignment required that the user enter their age and that it be less than 65 and greater than zero. I altered this slightly because the investment portfolio was for retirement and to contribute to a retirement account the user must have earned income. As such, I adjusted the age so that the user must be at least 18 years old.
